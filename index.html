        <h4>Augmented Reality: Application ofICT Tools for Innovative Pedagogy</h4>
        The goal of this research paper is the visualization of the difficult concepts by utilizing the AR technology, which can be a means to innovative learning for the kids seeking elementary education. The paper highlights the importance of utilizing the idea of incorporating learning through AR, instead of letting the kids watch videos on screen. In the current paper, the innovative learning results have been shown picturizing a simple concept of the solar system working. Here, free 3D models of the planets are downloaded from Sketchfab, thereby converted into.glb form, imported, implemented, and developed in PlugXR software.

        <h4>Online Cloud-Enabled Book Store System</h4>
        A simple book store website can be built using React.js for the frontend and Python's Flask framework for the backend API. The website can be deployed and managed using DevOps practices. DevOps refers to a set of practices that combine software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to improve collaboration and efficiency in the software development lifecycle. It involves automating processes, using version control systems, and deploying applications using tools like Docker and Kubernetes.
